    "description": "This project involved the creation of the digital version of the HOLC Residential Security Map from the 1930's that institutionalized the practice of redlining in Houston, and around America. I believe this is the first time this map has been brought online, I hope it will serve as a useful tool to explore how the practice of redlining still affects our city 80+ years later. The site has a live map built in @mapbox studio to begin exploring, and on the github repo there is a GEOJSON object that is free for public non-commercial use, but I would love to hear if and how this is of use if anyone uses it in a project or study.",
